# Wall of Outdated or Otherwise Misleading Specs

So, uh. IRC specifications. There are a _damn lot_ of them. And a _damn lot_ of those are a _damn lot_ outdated or simply misleading. Sure, there's attempts at [writing](http://ircv3.net) [new](https://modern.ircdocs.horse) [ones](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-oakley-irc-ctcp-01), but the simple fact is that most out there today that are still referenced are misleading.

This site tries to list the common IRC specs out there, and roughly catalogue the outdated or misleading sections of them.
